# Problem
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?  

Example  
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

# Solution
XOR
1 ^ 1 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1

```
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int num : nums) {
            result = result ^ num;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
